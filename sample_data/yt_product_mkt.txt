i can record and uh we don't have a ton
of items to get to uh and i might be able to do one that might
be fun if we have a little bit of time um so corporate events uh
they i think i saw a little i put this in in slack and i saw a little bit of uh
kind of noise around it which was good um
you know the the nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and tried different things um
the event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be uh so the current tactic
that we're going with is go to market team signs up and kind of sponsors that event
so you support it as a pmm your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event et cetera et cetera et cetera uh i don't
see anyone in the uh maybe their comments in the issue i don't see the the header updated yet
i thought we had in slack sort of farmed each one of them out that's so i guess the the next so it
looks like tai put in
some folks it looks like this looks good so that let's see
need support from gtm teams so i guess the ask would be
um to work with your gtm team so so did let me ask that i saw some slack
i think in our slack but did you all uh were you all able to connect with like your gtm
teams uh on slack only and on the issue
actually yeah same not even not in real time but you know source feedback i got one person to respond so far so it
may end up cindy being you and i just picking the one that we want to do and then they can back us up
if we don't get any more feedback yeah do y'all um does anybody have like
a regular sink still are those all been cancelled or is there
cases don't have a regular yeah we're on like a two-week cadence okay yeah git ops has been
cancelled after the enablement
cool so i'm just trying to catch up with the thread
um so it looks like maybe uh platform on reinvent
ci cd on google next and get ops on kubecon does that sound right yeah yep that's where we were last i
heard cool so then i think um
i think we can we can help the corp events team they do they do a lot of like uh cat hurting and
you know keep on tracking people down so i think if if this team can take the mission to
like try to help track that down so if you you know get the commitment specifically
from your campaign managers hey like we're signing up for kubecon you know can you comment on the issue that yes i
can commit to this etc etc etc you know um
so that just so that they can get that that event support but that looks good and i appreciate
uh thanks for the link to samya on the rolls uh product announcements
so i appreciate brian for adding this i probably should have added it but
i had two questions about that one one is over what time frame are we looking at
so uh so in theory this is this could be the same as the
gitlab 14 launch where we're saying basically since 13.0 what has
you know what kind of big improvements have we made um candidly this is always a little bit
tough and i'm and i'm i'm not totally sure of all of the
kind of the interplay here but i think i think this is kind of the general gist
of this assignment is okay we have commit coming up we have some amount of
like we have a stage uh you know a metaphorical stage to say something to
the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event right what kind of announcements do we
make at gitlab it's really really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely
public yada yada yada so the thought here is to
but also because our entire roadmap is completely public and because we ship these tiny little nbc's
a a new feature will come out but it'll be not really usable right so it takes a
while so if you look back over the past year and say okay like what started in the last year but now is
really like a full-fledged feature what would what would be coming out of beta right like if we were any other company
when we started a beta program in this last year what would we be announcing is ga at commit that's kind of that's kind of
my thought on it did i see a couple head nods what do you think cindy
yeah i think i was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability
management because there were tiny little mvcs all the way along but if you look at over the course of the year
we went from this to this it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in
any individual little thing and then the other point was we just
had 14.0 can we just can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here
absolutely yeah yeah and vulnerability management was was one of the
you know the features out of we looked at 14.00 so i think yeah this is like let's take the stuff
from 14.00 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press
or give give our pr team this is kind of like input into our pr team to give them fodder to go out with
and are we trying to hit three per stage i yeah ideally there's just you know
three you know uh three items per stage and then i think y'all made some good
notes that okay we need to add manage so i see manage in here that's excellent um and uh integrations we don't
well actually we have some pretty exciting integrations so we have the jira stuff is pretty good there's a couple of things in uh integrations with
vs code that could be notable but
i can i show what i did for scm just to get some general feedback on it and
if someone hasn't done it maybe that will also okay i was going cindy's direction here which
was uh thinking you know a lot of and then i called them key iterations the sort of specific
things so i listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations but i called them
something overall so we would have like one thing to call them
there are several key iterations aligned with getaway cluster uh several that roll up to a
research-based user experience and i was thinking like i was shy on calling out ux as as a
bucket except that actually that's that's super typical right like windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out they almost
always have ux as one of their three things and then they mention a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that
um so i i you know forgave myself for doing something at first i was kind of like shy about
calling out ux and bucketing some things there but actually when i looked around that's pretty much how everybody does
a big launch and in terms of the excitement level that also like i went in thinking this is
just a two i guess part of it is like i feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken
and that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about but actually some of that stuff's really cool so i gave it a three
excitement level i wasn't sure exactly where to place things um but i figured i wouldn't like to cindy's
comment have something that's a one here anyway but i the only way i could make sense of like the iterations
was to to bucket them with something and uh so that's kind of how i came down on
it i don't know what everyone thinks about that
i like that
i've done a similar i've taken a similar approach for monitor um with incident management
there were a bunch of things that we released um although the core of incident management was
part of trial.x i think so um i did the same over there as well yeah i
think that makes sense yeah and that that would help me with the planned stuff as well because there
are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have and
that's great but i think you know like the the milestone burn up charts
that that was a two and that's that's helpful and i was looking through features and you know actual monthly
features that were released in a given month i mean that was one of the more important ones but it's not very exciting but
we can bundle that with some other things and and up level it so that that would be
helpful there and also brian about the vs code thing one other cool thing about that is both of those vs code integrations that hit
the same month were community contributions which is also kind of cool is
is that is do we have vs code listed on here i didn't add it but i can i can add that
in i've got good notes on that the extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of
the things but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that
and that i think that's a that's a pretty good note as well um we did that with
like our our terraform module right there was like a community module but now it's officially supported
so that's that's the you know that can be the line yes or no whether you can use the thing
uh for a lot of businesses so i think that's a good one too how are we measuring excitement levels
one two and three is there i was i was looking at
um maybe mau as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers
have started using that are interested in using that or not we
probably may not have it for everything but at least some of it wherever we have it is it's
probably something we can we can use yeah but we of course we need a benchmark level
of what mau we want to call one two or three i i think it's a little it's a little
bit of a judgment call like um you know for example cormac was
saying uh like epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time
now depending on how it's asked for maybe that means it's exciting or it's not right
um but usually when something gets a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it
then i would i would bump the excitement level on something like that um certainly if something and a lot of
people are using it the mau that's a that's another good measure i don't know that any
one of those needs to kind of be exclusive i think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual judgment call and just like what is
what is your feeling based on you know could be anecdotal like you talk to
customers and they're like really hyper excited about this
or you know maybe not which is which is okay i think it's okay um harsh responded to my comment about
why we have the low excitement once and just said something about having him sort of stack ranked
yeah i might i might even constrain this is we're not
going to highlight log segments but we want to see the full spectrum especially in the case we have slim
pickings alternately uh if there are double digit entries then we can stack rank
um so that's that's kind of also helpful there so if
if we have three for all of these that i mean it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot
of features so um i might constrain it like this
maybe you can only give out one one two or three
and and treat it as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't
necessarily hard somebody's one or somebody's three
may be more important than somebody else's one depending and i had um i started by just
looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year uh from from create and
you know there are at least a dozen things that i'm not mentioning uh that could be on the list like i
could give you ten things instead of three yeah give it give this just like the rough
like pass and um like a lot of things recently i've been
moving between docs and spreadsheets and the spreadsheet to docs uh this you know this might this might
end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in pr is like okay out
of all of like the you know there's maybe 10 boxes here in three each out of the 30 items which are
the top five um actually let's just let's actually just do that
let's just do this like top top five overall this one is a pr driven to some
degree what about like the noob and christie's uh product keynote at commit are we tailing this with that
so so this is exactly where this is headed to um is the idea that um
during the product keynote and then ideally during sid's keynote as well that there's some level
of like an announcement that we make that then the press cares about that announcement
um again really tough to do at gitlab because it's all been around for a while so this is this is our attempt to head
to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah maybe it's some things that
have been around for a while but like now they're at a level of maturity now you know there's
there's reason to be excited about this so that's kind of where it's coming from so
i put uh a top five overall
maybe we can just uh you know
we should reserve a spot for plan but i'm gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this just go
through the list of what's shipped in the last 12 months and re-bucket that
so uh
maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like um just just time boxing uh kind of look at
these here what do what do you all think is uh top would be a top five out of the list of you know
20 or 30. i would say if ux does end up being a
flag that we fly that's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage
that would be considered ux improvement okay
what else we need to have a security one in there we could have either vulnerability management or um
i was what i've been struggling with a little bit is i'd like to kind of group the um some of this
the proprietary scanning um
without making it sound like they're scanning improvements because that sounds like they weren't good before
yeah i let's let's go with vulnerability management for now i i
and i would agree on that one and i would say that um some of these we did do some press
around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing so we might not get that
kind of old i was i mean we did the fuzzing acquisitions
a long time ago was it within the past year or longer
i thought it was within the past year i think it was in the last little over six months or so it was last
summer right or something around there it was like last spring or summer and then we did another set
of press around the integration of it because the pr team liked all the
i mean we got a lot of attention on the acquisition so they had me do a follow-up um on
the integration i just feel like it's kind of worn out now but right that's what i was saying is
that the the fuzzing we already did press on so we probably will not get another chomp at that so i think let's
go with vulnerability management unreviewed but we also have in terms of
proprietary stuff we've also got we replaced one of our scanners with
semgrip and we did um we have our own proprietary dast
scanner now that's in it's in beta called browser so it's our answer to
scanning single page applications which represent a unique challenge i think
i mean if i could have two it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably okay some grip could get picked up as a
online item and a couple of the pieces about getback 14. [Music]
which between between the the proprietary ships and the vulnerability management which would you pick as
number one out of those two probably vulnerability management okay
i'm just kind of scanning the list i would probably say like kubernetes agent is something that we've
made a lot of investment in although
i think the communities agent and from an integration point of view
uh perhaps the terraform integration i think we have a lot of customers actually using that
already so i'm gonna agree i'm just gonna call those get
ops and i'm gonna put like ks agent plus
hashi corp integrations it's like a bucket of capabilities that
is probably worth talking about
uh cool well let's you know let's try to uh
this is due tuesday i think we want to try to get this done um so maybe just uh
review this kind of like let's just kind of pick top five maybe something from planning something
from ci cd uh yeah pipeline editor is definitely an option for ci cd
um yeah there might be no sorry there might be a value stream
analytics story in there too um if we aggregate at all it's it's a bummer that customizable value stream
analytics is 12.9 um but uh yeah
there might be cool now i'm just gonna i'm gonna ping
you on this cormac to add at a top five plan
cool uh i think that's a pretty heavy pretty heavy list
just looking at it you know it's pretty cool yeah and this is something we don't do
which i i agree like we don't we don't often
stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins no uh i was really i don't did y'all did
anybody miss uh what do we call it assembly the assembly
um if you missed it i recommend it i laughed because like what assembly reminds me of is like
when i was in like a young child in grade school yeah they'd had this big stack of like
carpet they were like squares of carpet and you go like you go into the gym and
you'd pull off this a square of carpet and all the children would sit on a square of carpet and that
was like you'd have an assembly yeah so that's why i remember that too put everyone in the gym
or like convert the half cafeteria gym you know take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room
and then take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just you know sit on them and it'll be
it'll be great beside aside from the goofy name i thought that um and of course we can't
talk about any of it on youtube but man that was like a really awesome look back at like
here's some wins and here's some exciting things that we've done um and so i think we just need to get
better at this as a company i think this exercise is an opportunity that um i think we do a little bit of that but this is doing it more so
uh samia you have some questions here for elita yes
so in the competitive sheet i was i mean i've already identified the
features for cd configure as well as uh monitor uh getting it
reviewed from pm my guess was or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of
competitors that we're going to compare to but the right competitors for that particular
stage right so for example for uh for monitor uh we may not have
like a github or something like that we would have monitor based competitors or was that the understanding because
we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage
i thought we were going to be using those competitors to compare against so i just wanted you
your input on what because i saw uh some of you have compared with the five
competitors already listed over there um they may not be relevant for example
cloud bs may not be relevant for monitor stage at all um so that's what i wanted to check with you
yeah that's the case i need to go back and look at the spreadsheet i mean if the competitor does not apply to that
particular stage they shouldn't be on that tab in the spreadsheet so are you saying that you see competitors on that
tab for a stage where they don't apply yeah i think it was copy pasted each
google has the same yeah so each sheet has has ado atlassian github jenkins j frog
and cloud piece right so that may not be relevant for monitor for configure it would be a different
set of competitors that we need to include which i think we already identified a while back i think we
identified top three competitors for every stage yeah we feared them that's when we
tiered them right tier one tier two tier three so this this where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors
that's probably why i cut and paste them because those are all tier ones so we're just focusing on tier one right
now so if they don't apply to that stage don't worry about it makes sense so just pick the ones out of
that list that apply to our stage right i just will just use the tier one
competitors and if they're not if they don't uh are not applicable then we don't have to fill out anything for
them yeah for now but then we'll move to tier two and tier three then we'll look at those other okay do
we need to add a line item for gitlab as well because i i think that's the same over here yeah we should
add i think you asked me that before right or someone asked me i'm just looking at
it brian out um yeah we're good yeah because the way
without it you're basically putting all the things that we're better at yeah for sure for sure yeah right
ideally when we picked like the 10 to 15 features though some of those were like get lab
only some of those were like gitlab didn't have well i thought it was
supposed to be none of them should be get lab only right it should be all through the lens of yeah yeah exactly yeah it should be like
market lens so yeah in an ideal world most of them are like this is what i'm shopping for this
solution some like some of them might be git lab only some of them like competitor only so that it's a
somebody would look at it and be like this looks honest and trustworthy and like a a accurate assessment of the market there
yeah and then yeah i think samia for this just to kind of reiterate for this one
we're only doing these five competitors so we'll do the other ones in a later stage and then uh
for if if the vendor builds like bills themselves as a platform
then we should specifically call out that they have zero so github builds itself as a platform it
sells itself that way um same with azure devops same with jfrog
well they all do for tier one except jenkins and cloudbees yeah yeah jenkins clappies does not yeah
but uh what is it you know azure devops github uh atlassian
and although atlassians we still need to figure something out there that as a matter of fact did i go back and add alaska because i based on
conversation i think we have to do it i don't think we can leave them all so did i i don't i have to look at this question
right it is atlassian is on that sheet okay yeah i went back and added them because based on discussion like my
my i wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner but we can't do that so
so yeah so for for those platform you know we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring if they have
like 0 out of 15 we should call that out um same with configure stuff or this
you know any those kind of capabilities
i think if we took that a step further it'd be good to even describe it in a way that doesn't just say our product stage and use like a value-based
description of what monitor and configure mean because otherwise we're just no that's not going to do any
good for us have you guys seen the new infographic that the uh design team has come up with
not yet oh you haven't no do we have a link to that quickly
william i don't know or you can throw it in the uh you can throw it in the um notes if you find it
all right let's see who can find it faster guarantee it not with the amount of tabs
i have open oh my god that's what i'm like it probably won't be me
so i this is why i send everything to a google uh gmail because the search is so
fast so i literally have a folder where all of my gitlab pings go
and i can just search for infographic and well i found it i found it i found it who could lick it first
i found it i found it so this is the one so this there's two this is the one for the single two
comparison but then for the um but it's going to look the same but then here's the one for
um i just put it in chat for you guys and here's the one for the platform
players so so we made it we made a couple
decisions along the way so um
one of the decisions was to just go with stages um it would have been like a whole
nother layer of okay if we don't go with just the get laps stages the ten stages what do what do we use um that has to be
determined reconciled all this kind of stuff like the you know
we kind of i don't know how long it's been since we updated those pages have like not been updated
but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort towards some progress so uh i concur that maybe configure and
monitor is not as descriptive as it could be but the place where it will
so actually i'll share one thing it just seems like the right time to do this right
manage is is even less descriptive than that so so um the way this is
the way this is getting built is off of a data model so um in theory these could change or be
updated where the underlying data remains the same right because like we're separating
like presentation layer from data layer uh so that's it's not going to be as
hard to update in the future as it currently is where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's like really really difficult to update
and then the other component is then not in this iteration we need to get something live but in the next iteration
you'll click on verify and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features
and that's where you can describe what the heck of verify is or what the heck i'm managing okay so we will have a number two that because i
was about to say you're gonna hate me for this but like we're we're we're being cyclical about the
same problem we had which being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages that was one of the big things
it's like okay 15 15 features what what is what are they why do i care
you know better yeah to say that means nothing to me looking at this this page
um but quick questions i'm not gonna be a debbie downer that's it no we're on top of it actually if you read the thread i
brought that up but she said we can't do it like right now which i understand but small thing what do you guys think about the
colors i don't know i usually let the designers handle that stuff they they i i like yeah
i i like the fact that there's no red on there oh you like that
that's what i was going for you liked it okay it's not it's not obviously negative
uh so we're saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that
because there's no you know these folks at 37 are in the red and they're terrible they just have less green or we would have less green
so it's not it's not being worse it's being less good and i i think that i think that lends
itself to working with you know your all the coopetation situations we're talking
about yeah yeah that's that's the goal is we want we want to generate a helpful asset
for the industry this is not just like marketing shill this should be like a helpful page uh so
it's like yeah the goal is to have a comparison comparing devops tools not a you know
this is all of our competitors and why we're better yeah um i i i think from a competitive
mindset and for me i'm like let's go hard let's put some red on there and that's just the way i think right
so but i brought it up and that for now we're going to stick with the green they recommend it we stick with the green and uh see how it goes
but i don't know i was feeling the red and yellow too so it is easy on the
eyes um it's you know there's something to be said for that so yeah uh cool well
we're almost up on time but i did want to share one thing that kind of came in like basically friday it was like late
thursday for me so this uh this is another thing a lot a lot of these things i don't have like a
ton of context on um i just know like we're just trying to up our game so like hey let's move fast
and do the best we can do um so this is a little bit of a messaging
framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to to fill in these boxes here
so uh and then this was the fodder that i got so there was these ones that
said like from road map to company vision we are transparent and a single source of truth countless
possibilities honestly i think this one's really like really pithy and catchy i really like it i really liked
uh what's the other one that i like that not everyone does
all in one for everyone so i just uh i don't know i like i just think so there's something catchy about that
um but i know that kind of catchy is not everyone's cup of tea all that's
to say is um the assignment here was that i took it was to write a pithy
few words like punchy statement for each of these three things uh so i
ended up with a single source of truth countless possibilities i like that a lot um this one i went with end to end
control over your software factory not as pithy but or like not as catchy
but um so what's the difference between that
slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security this this was the um
honestly so that so when i first got this it didn't have this
and it didn't have anything under security so this like what i'd do is just your iteration of it
yeah this is this is mine this is i just put here so that i would have like the original statements like
you know automate nearly anything collaborate on everything i kind of like that but i you know
this one i hate scale up speed up test up i don't think anybody tests up i think that's really goofy
so you hate it uh this one i love that for me it's i i love it or i hate it right um i love how i love how you're
just like bam uh so anyway the what i love in just in five minutes
now and then we can just kind of end the call is kind of like um anything that you would change this
out for anything that you would change this out for and then actually let's start here this one i
couldn't pick and i'll i'll tell you why it's because i i like things to have parody in in their
tone right so this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging but i hate
it if it's like a single source of truth that's like a noun phrase end to end control that's like a noun
item so you could say with git lab you get a single source of truth with git lab you get end to end control
and you can't say with git lab you get move fast with confidence no but
you can say more speed less risk i like that one the best i don't like the last one okay i agree that's that's why i put
this one at top was for that parody and then so it sounds like kind of y'all's thoughts or that's that's good
as well uh yeah the only thing it might be missing but i don't know how we do it without
over complicating it is well i guess less risk also implies higher quality
i guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together so i've talked myself out of not liking
that so yeah good cindy's last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that i stole from forgive
that 14 when she was out it was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making in it
she said it really elegantly and so i just kind of ended deliverables secure the factory and its deliverables
yeah i thought it was good to emphasize both because they mean different things
yeah yeah so you could say um secure and control your software
factory and its deliverables maybe that would encompass both
thoughts i'm i'm not a big fan of the it's it's deliverables is there can we say
like your software factory in your software or your your sub or in your product
sounds like car manufacturer you can say ip here but it just doesn't sound right
and that's always it's always shorthand yeah i like this one better
yeah i think i do too but but i appreciate the thought brian uh
and then the last thing i'll say is so this is this is my attempt to channel my inner
ash withers um i think ash is like super good at
just again just like the catchy or like the turn of phrase element to it
um and so like this kind of idea like single source of truth countless possibilities or all-in-one
for everyone there's something catchy about this so so here i was trying to like envision what is it that we actually
give you with this philosophy it's like it's velocity with confidence is what is what you get
um i like your move fast with confidence better than increase speed and stay on track
yeah so i was trying to i was thinking of like you know if you're like if you're in a race car
and like you go like super super fast like let's say you're in the bike race right and you're going so fast and somebody
holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses
right so it's almost kind of like you can you can keep going like faster and
faster and faster and if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack
you're not going to get tripped up by it because get labs you know it's testing is going to catch that security's going to catch that um
all of those elements that allow you to move faster but to do so with confidence because otherwise you're like the faster you go then it
gets more dangerous so trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where i was like stay on track but i didn't like it
either did you just open the door for a nascar partnership
hey nascar goes fast and turns left because of get loud
so you're our new ricky audience demographic so yeah so i don't think i like that one
and then i think between these two i like move fast with confidence but i don't like the
the verbiage of it because it doesn't have parody so that's where i think do you want to add maybe we can add high
confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement so it kind of combines
all of it so more speed less risk high confidence is kind of overused anyway like i see a
lot of competitors and vendors using it i really like the first one just more speed less wrist bam no trade-offs you know
just that's how it is ooh no trade-offs that's one of my
go-to's i love that one this this gets into the uh no trade-offs
the engine the engineer in me says there's never no trade-offs that's like saying like 100 secure
complex this is why we always say mitigate right we always say risk or less risk you never say no
that's everything with messaging right i mean not everything you know how about just more speed less risk with
confidence yeah more speed
the ricky bobby and me really did like the no trade off so parker yeah oh is that was that from uh
no but it could have been it's something ricky bobby would have said if anyone hasn't seen talladega nights they should
that's the homework for this weekend we talk about it on monday in our little
social report i often say thank you little eight pound five ounce baby juice
with the golden diapers i say that so often that i just think everybody has seen talladega nights but
then i realized that people that haven't are like william's really weird and then next week we'll watch step brothers
that's another great one so much room for activities okay um i'm gonna go with uh more speed
less risk than um i think this is due at the end of the day so
any additional thoughts i'm actually going to untag me it's strong all those are you know
cool those are good awesome well uh this was kind of fun to do a little bit of like
working together session and uh keep a little dazzle keep it rocking
good to see everybody see you soon
